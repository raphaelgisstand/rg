1) Padding is only placed on the top and/or bottom of the divs. The elements within these divs have padding on their sides. This saves you from any "box model math". Keep in mind, if you add any side padding or border to the div itself, it will be added to the width you define to create the *total* width. You may also choose to remove the padding on the element in the div and place a second div within it with no width and the padding necessary for your design. You may also choose to remove the padding on the element in the div and place a second div within it with no width and the padding necessary for your design.

2) No margin has been given to the columns since they are all floated. If you must add margin, avoid placing it on the side you're floating toward (for example: a right margin on a div set to float right). Many times, padding can be used instead. For divs where this rule must be broken, you should add a "display:inline" declaration to the div's rule to tame a bug where some versions of Internet Explorer double the margin.

3) Since classes can be used multiple times in a document (and an element can also have multiple classes applied), the columns have been assigned class names instead of IDs. For example, two sidebar divs could be stacked if necessary. These can very easily be changed to IDs if that's your preference, as long as you'll only be using them once per document.

4) If you prefer your nav on the right instead of the left, simply float these columns the opposite direction (all right instead of all left) and they'll render in reverse order. There's no need to move the divs around in the HTML source.

<p>Educators must champion the use of technology and become leaders in developing instructional learning environments. Implementation of technology in the curriculum enhances the learning experiences of the students. With the age of digital information, educators must address the demands of instantaneous knowledge. Developing comprehensive integrated technology must be facilitated by teachers in the classroom instructional strategies and school curriculum. Educators must share the visions of their colleagues when considering innovative learning strategies and capitalizing on what works well to improve student interest and learning. Education professionals must articulate the vision by developing policies that incorporate technology as a part of subject area lessons promoting excellence.  <!-- end .content --></p>
