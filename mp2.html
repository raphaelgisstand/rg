<h1 align="center"><a name="Top" id="Top"></a>Photoshop: Image Editing</h1>

<p><font size="5">From this Photoshop project, I learned a lot about image quality and editing. 
I learned how to enhance the quality of pictures and images. Photoshop editing 
tools are impressive and powerful. I spent over 12 hours a day learning how to 
use Photoshop. You must have patience and determination when learning new 
technology tools. For the 21st Century, it's all about the implementation of 
technology into the classroom. <span style="color:red">It is our job as teachers </span>to ensure that 
students are equip with the 21st Century skillset needed to become productive citizens in todays society.</font>

<h1>Image 1: The University of Akron (Bierce Library)</h1>

<p><font size="5">I took this picture with my SAMSUNG On5 cellphone standing on the outside 
second floor balcony of Zook Hall. The picture original size was 960 x 720. 
The first thing I did was <strong>resize the picture</strong> to 480.067 x 404.267. The next 
thing I did was use <strong>the spot healing brush tool</strong> to remove the two head stones 
from the grass out front of the library. I also used the spot healing tool to 
remove the people walking, the tree shadows on the concrete and the flyers 
from the windows of the library's main doors. The last thing I did with this 
photo was <strong>add the text</strong>, "The University of Akron" on the front wall of the 
library. They call this adding another layer to the photo. I <strong>cropped</strong> the left 
side of the photo to remove the window portion of the library that was 
visible. I had to tweak both the cyan and the yellow <strong>color balance</strong> alittle to 
bring out more definition, clarity and color.</font></p>

<h1>Image 2: The Lecture Hall</h1>

<p><font size="5">I took this picture of an empty lecture hall at the University of Akron 
with my SAMSUNG On5 cellphone. The picture original size was 720 x 960. The 
first thing I did was <strong>resize the picture</strong> to 269.966 x 359.955. The next 
thing I did was open a new window with a picture of the Arts and Science 
building at the Univesity of Akron. Then I used <strong>the transform selection tool </strong> to resize the picture so that it fits inside the projector screen on the 
lecture hall photo. I just <strong>added another layer </strong>to get this effect. To edge 
up around the projector screen, I used <strong>the magic eraser tool </strong>to help line 
everything up. The last thing I did to this photo was to give it the feel as 
if someone dimmed the lights and started playing a University of Akron 
documentary. To accomplish this effect, I had to set <strong>the brightness </strong>to 30 and 
I changed <strong>the contrast</strong> to 17. I also checked the option to use legacy.</font></p>
