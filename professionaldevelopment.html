1) Padding is only placed on the top and/or bottom of the divs. The elements within these divs have padding on their sides. This saves you from any "box model math". Keep in mind, if you add any side padding or border to the div itself, it will be added to the width you define to create the *total* width. You may also choose to remove the padding on the element in the div and place a second div within it with no width and the padding necessary for your design. You may also choose to remove the padding on the element in the div and place a second div within it with no width and the padding necessary for your design.

2) No margin has been given to the columns since they are all floated. If you must add margin, avoid placing it on the side you're floating toward (for example: a right margin on a div set to float right). Many times, padding can be used instead. For divs where this rule must be broken, you should add a "display:inline" declaration to the div's rule to tame a bug where some versions of Internet Explorer double the margin.

3) Since classes can be used multiple times in a document (and an element can also have multiple classes applied), the columns have been assigned class names instead of IDs. For example, two sidebar divs could be stacked if necessary. These can very easily be changed to IDs if that's your preference, as long as you'll only be using them once per document.

4) If you prefer your nav on the right instead of the left, simply float these columns the opposite direction (all right instead of all left) and they'll render in reverse order. There's no need to move the divs around in the HTML source.

    <p>Professional Development is preparation for educators and is necessary to equip them with the tools to teach and adapt to the changing landscape of education. Having knowledge of how students learn and the ways in which they learn best, educators can elect the appropriate lesson and incorporate the necessary technology tools. With differing levels of prior knowledge that students bring to the classroom, assessing student achievement levels can be useful for teachers in determining the most efficient instructional strategy that applies to all learners. Professional development is the preparation for teachers beyond the classroom setting. In my graduate student teaching field experiences at Inventor&rsquo;s Hall of Fame, Garfield High School and Litchfield Middle School, I gained  professional development working with adolescent to young adults. In my experience and participation with the LeBron James Family Foundation, I was trained in working with at-risk youth. While working at Project Learn, I was introduced to interacting with adult learners seeking their General Equivalency Diploma. The artifacts will illustrate the application of the knowledge that I learned while completing my Master degrees.</p>
