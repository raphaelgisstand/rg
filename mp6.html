<h1 align="center"><a name="Top" id="Top"></a>Digital Video Editing</h1>

<p><font size="5">I used <b>Windows Movie Maker 6.0</b> to make my video posted in the example below. Windows Movie Maker is a powerful digital video tool used for editing 
  videos, pictures, audio and text. The video I filmed and used was a live example of a read aloud being conducted at the Akron Public Library by 
  Jackie Goddard on 11/30/17. I wanted to show the importance and benefits behind, why we as teachers and parents should read aloud to our students and 
  children. Reading aloud is a very effective teaching strategy, because it builds up and improve children's reading self-esteem and literacy development. 
  When a child reads a book by themselves, it's hard for them to engage and stay focused. Most children have short attention spans and can easily get 
  bored while reading. This is what makes reading aloud so powerful, because when it's done properly, it should be riveting and engrossing. It is the job 
  of the teacher to <q>bring the children deeper into the meaning of the story</q> by an approach called <i>Dialogic Reading</i>. Reading aloud is 
  crucial because it opens the door for conversation. It is very important to discuss the book with the children by using follow up, and open-ended 
  questions (cognitive development, Bloom Taxonomy). The purpose for these types of discussions are intended for children to expand their thoughts, by 
  giving an in-depth analysis of the book, and to hear others perspectives and understanding. It states in the book entitled, <i>Teaching Children's Literature: It's Crucial 
  by Christine Leland,</i> that children who were brought up in a literate family did better in school versus those who didn't have this kind of upbringing. Statistics show 
  that <q>students who scored the lowest on all the tests were seldom read to; and students who scored the highest had experienced many stories and were already interested in 
  books and written language (Leland, pp.17-18).</q> Therefore, it is so crucial to read aloud to children at an early age. Statistics also show that the older students get, 
  the less motivated they are to read. So, the goal is to create that reader identity in all students, and to prevent borderline students from downward spiraling.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Before editing my video files in Windows Movie Maker 6.0, I first had to convert them from MP4 to AVI, so that it could be imported into Windows Movie Maker 6.0. 
  I also converted my video files to mp3 in order to use just the audio for certain parts of my project. I had to film two different read alouds because the first one I recorded 
  was in 4:3 aspect ratio and when I imported it into Windows Movie Maker, the picture was sideways, so I rotated the video 270 degrees so that it was upright. Then after I finally 
  got the video to show upright, it was in Pillarbox. It had black bars on the left and right side of the video, which made the video look unprofessional. I tried using several 
  video conversion programs to change my video from 4:3 to 16:9. After countless hours of downloading and testing out a lot of these programs, I was unsuccessful so, I had to film 
  another read aloud being held at the Akron Public Library. This time I set my phone's camera to record 16:9 and I filmed it with my camera sideways so that it will be wide 
  screen this time. It worked this time and i was able to create and edit my digital video project. The five transitions that I used were 
  <i>(Dissolve Rough, Slide Up Center, Flip, Shrink In, and Fade).</i> The five effects that I used were <i>(Fade In From Black, Fade Out To Black, Ease In, Ease Out, and I used 
  the Title Overlay feature).</i> The last thing I did was save my video project as a wmv file 320x240 so that It can be displayed on my mp6.html web page. I used Vimeo to get an 
  embed code to use to display my video project on my mp6.html web page.</font></p>
